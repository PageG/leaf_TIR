## Support code and data for the article

Code is organized as follows:

* leaf area measurement code along with scanned data is in directory `./data/leaf_scans/` [Matlab]
* thermal/color imagery registration code is in directory `./registration/` [Python]
* transient leaf energy balance model implimented for both average leaf temperature and pixel-scale data is in `./model/` [R]
* all data is in directory `./data/` [*.csv]

Code and data from time of publication has been archived at [Zenodo.org](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1167842), DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1167842
