## Support code and data for the article

Code is organized as follows:

* leaf area measurement code along with scanned data is in directory `./data/leaf_scans/` [Matlab]
* thermal/color imagery registration code is in directory `./registration/` [Python]
* transient leaf energy balance model implimented for both average leaf temperature and pixel-scale data is in `./model/` [R]
* all data is in directory `./data/` [*.csv]

Data and code will be assigned a DOI using [Zenodo.org](www.zenodo.org) once the article is accepted for publication.
